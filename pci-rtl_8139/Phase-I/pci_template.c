/* 
 * Realtek RTL8139 PCI Ethernet Wired card Driver template.
 * 
 * Implement PCI portion of rtl8139 Network Card driver
 * Use this as a template. Add code in areas matching string "CODE HERE".  
 * In this phase of the project we will be writing PCI routines. 
 * Net Device and ISR routines will be implemented in PHASE 2.
 * Compile the driver as module. Use the makefile provided earlier
 * Unload the production module or blacklist it: 
 * # lspci -v  -- This will show any module or driver bound to this card
 * # rmmod 8139too -- Unload the production driver
 * # lsmod - list loaded modules
 * Load the driver after adding required code: 
 * # insmod pci.ko
 * Run "ifconfig -a", You should see: 
 * - MAC Address read from the device memory
 * - IRQ number read from the device memory
 * - Device IO memory base address read from the device memory
 *
 * Guidelines are provided to assist you with writing the pci portion of the 
 * driver. Do not limit yourself to it. You are encouraged to review source 
 * code of production driver.
